The application also, provides a contact section where the user can contact me, this is a future development to actually send e-mail with a request.

The Contact Me section also provides the capability of sending an e-mail directly through the website which opens the mail to window and fills in the subject and the body of the e-mail with the contact information and the message. The user can also reset the fields in the form using the reset button.
